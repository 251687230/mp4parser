Java MP4 Parser
====================

A Java API to read, write and create MP4 files. And I mean MP4 files - 
I'm not talking encoding or decoding of audio and video!

What can you do?
--------------------

aac -> MP4 
ac3 -> MP4
ec3 -> MP4
h264 -> MP4

What can't you do?
--------------------

Create JPEGs from a movie. No - this is no decoder. The MP4 Parser doesn't know how to do that. 
Create a movie from JPEGs
